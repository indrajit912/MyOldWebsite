        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Greetings! I am honored to introduce myself as a Senior Research Fellow in the 
            Theoretical Statistics and Mathematics Unit (SMU) at the Indian Statistical Institute, 
            Bangalore Centre. My area of interest lies broadly in the domain of Operator Algebra, with 
            a pronounced focus on von-Neumann algebras, Type $II_1$ factors, and $C^*$-algebras.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I have the privilege of being guided by the esteemed 
            <a href="https://www.isibang.ac.in/~soumyashant/" target="_blank">Dr. Soumyashant Nayak</a>
             on this rewarding journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the academic sphere, my heart finds solace in the written word. 
            A devoted book enthusiast, I embark on journeys of exploration and knowledge 
            through reading. Collecting and indulging in books is a source of great joy for me, 
            with a special fondness for the realms of science, mystery, and Bengali literature.
        </p>
        <p>
            Embracing holistic well-being, I advocate for physical health. The afternoons witness 
            my spirited engagement in invigorating sessions of Badminton and Table Tennis, fostering 
            a balanced lifestyle within the vibrant confines of the ISI campus.
        </p>
        <p>
            Proficient not only in the abstraction of mathematics but also in the practical realm 
            of programming, I wield Python as a potent tool to navigate and dissect intricate 
            mathematical landscapes. My toolkit extends to Latex, C, C++, and SQL, empowering me 
            to tackle challenges from multiple perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Feel free to peruse my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1oqircttm4w5rhcjce0cm/main.pdf?rlkey=s8st2hfwihymkwv8lod1c6mgj&dl=0" target="_blank">CV</a>, a testament to my academic journey.
